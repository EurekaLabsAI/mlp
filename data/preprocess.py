"""
This script documents how we took the original names.txt dataset
and split it into train.txt, val.txt, test.txt splits.
TLDR we shuffled the names, took the first 1000 for val, rest for train.

Process:
- navigate to this directory (data/)
- download the names.txt file to this directory, e.g.:
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/makemore/master/names.txt
- run this script
python preprocess.py
- this creates train.txt, val.txt, test.txt (which are checked in to git)
